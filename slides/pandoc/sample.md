## Speaker Notes

Add speaker notes with (:::) delimitation

>  ::: notes
>
>  your notes go here
>
>  important: ":::" go before AND after the notes
>
>  :::

::: notes

don't forget the final ":::" after the note

:::

## Adding html directive

* html markup is directly included in the output
* html comment `<!-- comment -->` can be used
- This links to <a href="http://google.com">google</a>
- what is the best way to add styles?

## Inline CSS Editing

* Interesting, but probably not useful

<style contenteditable="true" style=" display: block; background-color: #2d2d2d; color: #0F0; padding: 1em; white-space: pre; width: 100%; overflow: auto; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left">
  /* Put CSS here and watch your page update as you type */
  blockquote {
    background-color: #f00 !important;
    text-align: left;
  }
</style>

::: notes

Nicer speaker notes
